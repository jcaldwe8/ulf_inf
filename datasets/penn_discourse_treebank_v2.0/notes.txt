The data is kinda strange.  Similar to discourse graphbank the texts are split
into context and further into the discourse components.  It's probably easier
to remove the bracketing from WSJ and then do some sort of fuzzy matching with
the dataset.  Or take a look at the manual to find a way to get the text.
Perhaps util/ has some tool that can be used to extract the text.
