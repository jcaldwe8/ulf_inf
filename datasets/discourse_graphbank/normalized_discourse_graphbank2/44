The Agriculture Department says Americans seem to be eating a bit more each year but are choosier about what 's on the menu .
A 20-year statistical study by the department 's Economic Research Service found that per capita food consumption overall rose 0.7 percent in 1987 to a record level , including a 1.8 percent increase in foods from crops , while food from animals dropped 0.3 percent .
Analysts said the decline in animal products occurred as a result of lower per capita consumption of beef , eggs , whole milk , butter , lard and edible tallow .
The agency cautioned in the report about taking the figures too literally because much of the information is derived from farm-to-market statistics and other trade information .
`` Strictly speaking , the food disappearance estimates should be designated as supplies moving through trade channels for domestic consumption , '' the report said .
`` However , because most foods are perishable , changes in disappearance presumably are associated with changes in actual consumption . ''
The information is useful as an indicator of trends , even if `` it is not a measure of actual consumption or the quantity ingested '' by consumers , the report added .
For example , the latest review by USDA economists said that crop food consumption rose 17 percent from 1967 to 1987 , compared with a 3.5 percent increase in the consumption of animal products .
`` Consumption of foods in most crop categories has risen steadily in the last 20 years , especially fats and oils , vegetable , grain products and sweeteners , '' the report said .
`` Use of fruit jumped in the mid-1980s .
In contrast , Americans used less red meat , eggs , fluid milk and cream , and animal fats , moderating the increase for animal products . ''
Of all the meat consumed by Americans in 1987 , 59 percent was red meat - mainly beef and pork - compared with 71 percent in the early 1970s .
Instead , people ate more poultry and fish .
In 1987 , for the first time , the per capita consumption of poultry , on a retail weight basis , was greater than beef - 78 pounds per person , compared with 73 pounds , the report said .
But there 's a catch .
Measured on the basis of boneless weight , Americans still ate more beef - 69 pounds versus 55 pounds .
`` That is because poultry at the retail level contains relatively more bone than beef does , '' the report said .
Per capita consumption of fishery products in 1987 was a record 15.4 pounds , up 45 percent from 1967 and 21 percent more than in 1977 .
Egg consumption in 1987 dropped 23 per cent to a per capita average of 249 eggs from 322 in 1967 .
The all-time record was 403 eggs in 1945 .
In the period of 1985-87 , the United States led the world by consuming an average 248 pounds of red meat and poultry per person .
That is a `` carcass weight '' equivalent before a slaughtered animal is divided into smaller cuts .
Australia was second at 230 pounds carcass weight per capita , followed by Argentina and New Zealand , each at 226 pounds .
The Soviet Union , by comparison , averaged 145 pounds per capita .
Japan and Iceland lead the world in the consumption of fishery products .
In the period of 1982-84 , the typical Japanese consumed annually an average of 190 pounds of fish and shellfish , liveweight equivalent , more than five times , the consumption of the average American .
