The government says consumer prices rose 1,722 percent last year , the highest single-year mark in memory , and one economic forecasting firm predicts they will rise at more than three times that rate this year .
Economists say the rampant inflation is tied to a steep recession that weakened the economy following a growth rate of 8.5 percent in 1986 and of 6.7 percent in 1987 .
Economy Minister Carlos Rivas said last week that early estimates indicate the economy shrank 8.4 percent in 1988 .
`` We are now paying the price for two years of growth , '' President Alan Garcia said recently .
The crisis has been marked by shortages of basic foods , such as milk , sugar and bread , and by increasing discontent among the 21 million Peruvians .
Political analysts say the flagging economy together with a relentless insurgency by leftist guerrillas are undermining Peru 's frail democracy .
Rivas said a major cause of record inflation was government deficit spending to finance consumer subsidies .
The inflation figure of 158.3 percent set in 1985 had been the highest since Peru began keeping such records in 1920 .
The National Statistics Institute , in its report Monday , said consumer prices in December increased by 40.9 percent compared with the month previous .
Garcia , a center-left populist , took office in July 1985 and used Peru 's dollar reserves to subsidize imports needed for Peru 's economic recovery .
Consumer prices surged early in 1988 after the reserves ran out and the government maintained its program of subsidies through heavy deficit spending , said economists , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The respected economics analysis firm Apoyo predicted inflation this year will hit at least 6,000 percent .
