Cuban President Fidel Castro has pledged the U.S. Catholic Conference he will free the remaining 225 prisoners the Havana government has recognized as political , the Washington Post said in its Wednesday editions .
The group of prisoners include 44 the Cuban government has previously described as too dangerous to release from jail , the paper said , citing an unidentified senior Cuban official and western diplomats .
The Catholic conference has been pressing since 1985 for the prisoners ' release , the diplomats were quoted as saying .
Of the 476 prisoners on the government 's roster of those who have faced political charges , about 225 remain in jail .
Some 250 were released during 1988 .
The political prisoners the government has acknowledged include those named in a list of about 450 presented to Cuba in May 1988 by Cardinal John O'Connor of New York City , according to the Post .
During the summer , Castro said that everyone on that list would be freed except 44 , whom he described as too dangerous .
The government has not admitted that anyone else among its approximately 30,000 prisoners is being held on political charges .
Castro says now he will free the 44 prisoners he originally rejected , on the condition they be granted visas to travel immediatly to the United States , the Post said a high-ranking Communist Party official confirmed .
Among those to be liberated are the last four of 64 plantados , prisoners who refused on principle to participate in rehabilitation programs or in some cases to wear jail uniforms , the Post said .
Some have been jailed since the first years after the 1959 revolution .
However , the Post said , it remained unclear whether all of the prisoners would be eligible to go to the United States .
At least 24 released last year were denied visas because of criminal histories , according to a list drawn up by Elizardo Sanchez , head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation .
