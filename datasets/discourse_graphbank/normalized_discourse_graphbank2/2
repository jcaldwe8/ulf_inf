An early morning house fire killed a woman and a firefighter who was fatally injured as he searched the house , officials said Saturday .
Four other members of the woman 's family were injured .
Fire Investigator Ray Mauck said the 4 a.m. fire started in the front room of the house in northwest Wichita but he would not comment on the cause .
`` We are fairly sure at this time that it was an accidental fire , '' he said .
Killed were Tilda Sue Price , 53 , and firefighter C.C. Killingsworth , 39 , a 17-year veteran of the Wichita Fire Department .
Mrs. Price 's husband , Everett Price , 63 , and their daughters , Corine , 22 , and Valrie , 16 , escaped and were in serious condition Saturday night at St. Francis Regional Medical Center , hospital officials said .
Another firefighter was treated for minor injuries and released .
Killingsworth 's colleagues praised him a dedicated firefighter .
`` He was a very aggressive firefighter .
He loved the work he was in , '' said acting Fire Chief Larry Garcia said .
`` He could n't be bested in terms of his willingness and his ability to do something to help you survive . ''
Firefighters never reached Mrs. Price , who was trapped in her bedroom , Garcia said .
They had to cut short their rescue effort just before the roof caved in .
The woman 's daughters escaped from a second-story bedroom by climbing down ladders put up on the side of the house by firefighters .
