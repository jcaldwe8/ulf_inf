The weather continues to be the biggest question mark for Agriculture Department economists trying to figure out where U.S. farm production may be headed in 1989 .
For example , most analysts say the historical record shows little chance that the devastating drought of 1988 - which shriveled crop production by 30 percent - will repeat this year .
But the drought 's effects are still apparent in much of the land , where subsoil moisture has yet to recover .
And even long-shot odds of the 1988 heat and drought repeating are causing USDA economists a few nightmares .
The uncertainties are important as the economists look at all crop prospects , but they are particularly vital for feed grains and how this year 's output might affect livestock producers .
Dave Hull of the department 's Economic Research Service says in the January-February issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine the acreage of corn and other feed grains is expected to increase in 1989 because of a relaxation in the government 's land-idling requirements .
The program changes , he said , could add 8 million to 10 million acres to this year 's corn plantings .
In all , the corn area for harvest next fall could be in the range of 67 million to 69 million acres , compared with an estimated 56.7 million harvested in 1988 .
Last year 's corn production was 4.67 billion bushels , down from 7.06 billion in 1987 and 8.25 billion in 1986 .
Yields averaged 82.3 bushels per harvested acre , compared with more than 119 bushels per acre in each of the two previous years .
`` Many estimates of 1989 corn yields range from 110 to 115 bushels per acre , although these forecasts may be weighting the 1988 disaster and potential weather problems a bit too heavily , '' Hull said .
`` If weather cooperates ( in 1989 ), yields of 120 bushels per acre are not out of the question , considering long-term trend increases of more than 2 bushels per year . ''
If that happens , he said , farmers could harvest between 7.7 billion and 8.3 billion bushels of corn next fall .
Hull said that if 1989 corn production is at the low side of these projections farmers probably would see some decline in market prices in the 1989-90 season .
The agency currently projects corn prices will average $2.40 to $2.80 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year that began last Sept. 1 .
But if this year 's harvest is at the higher end of the projection range , the price decline would be much sharper as U.S. stockpiles once again start to rebuild .
Hull said prices then could drop in 1989-90 to near the government 's price support loan rate of $1.65 per bushel .
`` If yields return to normal , 1989-90 production of barley , oats and sorghum also is likely to rebound , '' he said .
`` Stocks of barley and oats would tend to build modestly if production returns to normal , and prices probably will fall . ''
Soghum output `` is likely to rebound '' this year if yields are normal , although total use may continue to exceed production , Hull said .
Prices will probably continue to be pegged to roughly 90 percent of corn prices .
