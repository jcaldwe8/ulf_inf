The family of a Belfast man held hostage in Beirut marked his 1,000th day in captivity with a vigil outside city hall .
Brian Keenan , a teacher with dual British and Irish nationality , was kidnapped April 11 , 1986 on his way to the American University in Beirut , where he had just begun to work .
`` If we forget , the world forgets , '' said his sister , Brenda Gillham , who stood outside the city hall with three other family members during Wednesday 's vigil .
`` We must keep the fight going . ''
She said the vigil was both for the family members and to `` ask governments: How many more days can a normal human being take ?
Maybe the governments will start to think about it . ''
Keenan , 38 , was using an Irish passport when he was abducted , but both the Irish and British governments are working toward his release .
The British government also seeks the release of Anglican envoy Terry Waite and journalist John McCarthy .
And it seeks word on Alec Collett , a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him .
His body was never found .
In all , 15 foreigners are missing in Lebanon and believed held hostage .
They include nine Americans , among them Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson , who was abducted on March 16 , 1985 .
