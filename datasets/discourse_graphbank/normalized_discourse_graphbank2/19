The Duke and Dutchess of York did not set a trend by naming their daughter Beatrice - at least not among parents who announced the birth of a child in the Times of London last year .
Alice and Charlotte were the most popular girls ' first names chosen by those parents , says Helen Beard , the paper 's social editor .
`` The royal birth on Aug. 8 seems to have had no effect on the commoners ' choice , at least among Times-reading parents , '' she wrote on Monday .
Lists of most popular names have become a favorite feature in the paper at this time each year .
One list - all-names - comprises the names that most often appear in cases where parents give their children two or more forenames .
The second list - first-names - comprises only the most popular choice of first forename chosen by parents .
Ms. Beard wrote: `` A total of 5,531 births were gazetted ( in 1988 ), of whom 2,659 were girls and 2,872 were boys ; ( in 1987 ), out of a total of 5,477 , boys were in a majority of 134 .
`` James again led both the first-name and the all-names leagues for boys .
Elizabeth was still way ahead in the girls ' all-names list ; but she failed even to obtain a place ( among the top 10 ) in the first-name league , which is now jointly led by Alice ( for the first time ) and Charlotte .
`` In the all-names leagues , Henry supplanted Christopher , while Rose , Alexandra and Lucy ousted Emma , Jane and Emily .
Katherine is back among the first names ( out goes Rebecca). The list of boys ' first names and their order are little changed , but Christopher , Robert and Henry squeezed out George and Benjamin . ''
The Times has a daily circulation of about 450,000 in this country of 56 million people .
