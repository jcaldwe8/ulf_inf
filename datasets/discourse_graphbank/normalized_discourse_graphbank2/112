An automobile magazine that could n't resist the trademark battle between General Motors Corp. and an Italian gun maker did a `` road test '' comparison of Beretta , the pistol , and Beretta , the Chevy .
Car and Driver , its editorial tongue planted firmly in its cheek , has a story in its current issue with the headline: `` We 've shot from the hip before , but never like this . ''
Fabbrica d'Armi P. Beretta SpA , the gun company , sued GM for $250 million in federal court in New York last July , claiming that the car infringes on the pistol 's trademark .
The case is pending .
The Car and Driver comparison was thought up by Editor William Jeanes , and was written by New York Contributing Editor Bruce McCall .
`` For our test , we chose a 1989 Beretta V-6 GTU two-door notchback coupe and a 1989 Beretta 16-round Model 92F 9mm Parabellum , the spiffiest models in their respective lineups , '' McCall wrote .
The magazine listed these details:  Curb weight: Beretta , the pistol , 2.5 pounds ; Beretta , the Chevy , 2,847 pounds .
Top speed: Beretta , the gun , 878 mph ( at the barrel end ); Beretta , the sedan , 114 mph .
Price , as tested: Beretta , the semiautomatic , $596 ; Beretta , the car with an automatic transmission , $15,428 .
Along with the facts and figures , there are some performance opinions in the article:  --``The Beretta 92F ( the pistol ) ... hates corners more than any device C-D has tested since the 1964 AMC Marlin . ''
--``We liked the solid heft and natural feel of the Italian lightweight .
It falls easily to hand .
... No such provision is designed into the five-speed Getrag shifter fitted to our U.S. test sample , perhaps because while the Italian aims to be on the hip of everybody in uniform , the American aims only to be uniform among everybody hip . ''
--``You can field-strip the Italian in minutes without tools , while the same task performed on the Chevy would require countless hours and untold broken fingernails . ''
