A relative of a Mafia informant whose testimony has helped put hundreds of people behind bars has been shot to death in an apparent underworld vendetta , police said .
Sebastino Lombardo , 41 , was gunned down Tuesday as he was driving home on the outskirts of Palermo .
It was not immediately known how many people were involved in the attack .
Lombardo was thebrother-in-law of Salvatore `` Totuccio '' Contorno , a Mafioso-turned-informant whose testimony helped convict 338 defendants in the Mafia trial that ended in December 1987 and was Italy 's largest ever .
One of Contorno 's brothers , Giuseppe , was murdered in Sicily last September .
The shooting came a month after Contorno testified before Italian magistrates , who questioned him in the United States to prepare another mass Mafia trial .
Police blamed the Mafia for both slayings .
One investigator , speaking on condition of anonymity , said it was not clear if the Mafia targeted Contorno 's relatives out of pure revenge or because they were suspected of being his own informers .
Last month , Italy 's state television broadcast an interview with Contorno that was conducted at an undisclosed location in the United States .
In the interview , Contorno assessed the current state of the Mafia and spoke of its connections with judges and politicians .
After Tomasso Buscetta , Contorno is considered the state 's star witness against the Sicilian Mafia .
As part of a deal for helping the Americans in the `` Pizza Connection '' heroin investigation , the 42-year-Contorno receives $1,300 a month and is moved from location to location under the U.S. government 's witness protection program .
