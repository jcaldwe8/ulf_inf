Two masked men claiming to be Red Brigades terrorists shot and wounded the assistant director of a prison after trying to seize him , authorities said .
Egidio de Luca was returning to his home near Tivoli , about 30 miles northeast of Rome , on Tuesday night the two men blocked his path , police said .
The assailants , armed with pistols , identified themselves as members of the `` New Red Brigades of the Fighting Communist Party '' and tried to grab de Luca , they said .
When he reached for his gun , the men shot him in the thigh , police said .
A bodyguard following de Luca then started shooting at the assailants , who fled to a nearby car and escaped .
De Luca was hospitalized in Tivoli in serious condition , police said .
The Red Brigades , a collection of far-left terrorist groups , used killing , kidnapping and `` knee-capping '' - shooting someone in the knee - to try to destroy confidence in the Italian state during the 1970s and early 1980s .
The group has greatly diminished in size in recent years .
The Fighting Communist Party is a military wing of the Red Brigades and , according to the Italian news agency AGI , the New Red Brigades is a faction with about 100 members , most of them very young .
De Luca is assistant director of Rome 's Rebibbia prison , which holds 1,300 people and includes a maximum-security section that holds terrorists , among others .
De Luca is responsible for a section with people accused of common crimes , AGI said .
Employees of the prison in the past have been victims of Red Brigades attacks .
De Luca 's home was firebombed in 1980 , when he was employed at the prisons office of the Justice Ministry , the Italian news agency ANSA said .
No one claimed responsibility for the attack .
The last Red Brigades killing was in April , when Sen. Roberto Ruffilli was shot near his home in Forli in northern Italy .
