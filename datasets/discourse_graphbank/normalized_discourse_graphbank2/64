One of every three men and women walking down the aisle in the United States has been married before , but the remarriage rate for divorced Americans has been declining , according to a National Center for Health Statistics report .
The government report also shows that most divorced men marry divorced women and that of those divorced Americans remarrying in 1983 , the women were on the average 34 years old and the men , an average 37 years old .
The report is based on samples of records from states that compile marriage and divorce statistics .
It studies data collected from 1970 to 1983 , the latest year for which most of the figures were available .
The number of remarriages increased during the period studied , rising from 404,000 in 1970 to 736,000 in 1983 for divorced women and from 423,000 to 773,000 over the 14-year period for divorced men .
But although the number of remarriages was growing over those years , the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster , the report said .
In 1983 , the remarriage rate for divorced women was 91.6 per 1,000 compared with 123.3 per 1,000 in 1970 .
The rate for divorced men was 142.1 per 1,000 compared with 204.5 per 1,000 in 1970 , the report said .
`` Thus , only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent of divorced men remarried in 1983 , compared with 12 percent of divorced women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970 , '' the report said .
The figures also show that most women marry men of the same marital status .
In 1983 , the report said , 55 percent of all women and men who married were both single , 19 percent were both divorced and 2 percent were both widowed .
Men traditionally are older than the women they marry , and this generally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages , according to the study .
The only combinations in which that trend is broken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men .
In 1983 , widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women were an average 1 year older than the single men they married .
Many of the patterns for first marriages do n't hold up for second and subsequent marriages , the report noted .
While more than three-quarters of first marriages are performed in religious settings , the proportion drops to about 60 percent for marriages involving divorced men and women .
Also , first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern -- many more are performed in the summer than in the winter , the report said .
But second and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly throughout the year .
