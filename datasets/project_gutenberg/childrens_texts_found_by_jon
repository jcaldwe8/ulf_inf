They need to be edited to remove the license, word lists, etc. If you're interested in using them, I can do that.

Unfortunately a lot of classic children's texts like the Richard Scarry books or the Dick and Jane ones are still in copyright (death of author + 70 yrs is a long time!) If we really want any of them, they shouldn't take long to type up.

Here are some slightly more advanced texts:

Some problematic content (fairy tales):

There are graded readers going through high school, but I expect there to be issues with dialogue and poetry.
