wget_dataset.py 
  Downloads book lists from Project Gutenberg.  The books are downloaded in
  text file formats (.txt or .txt.utf-8 extensions) and books where a text
  format does not exist are ignored.  This tends not to be an issue because
  books without text file formats tend to be specialized documents (e.g.
  scientific documents, dictionaries, etc.) which we are not interested in.
