Files from Project Gutenberg : https://www.gutenberg.org

wget_dataset.py is a script for downloading books lists from Project Gutenberg.
The books are downloaded in text file formats (.txt or .txt.utf-8 extensions)
and books where a text format does not exist are ignored.  This tends not to be
an issue because books without text file formats tend to be specialized
documents (e.g. scientific documents, dictionaries, etc.) which we are not
interested in.
