For all the comments below, see comments in the file for details.

'scold' and associated entries seem problematic -- at least for the type of
inference marked in the original list.  Left them unmodified for now.
Looking at it again a couple days later it seems okay, but much worse than the
prepositional forms.

'confess' modified to include tense and progressive aspect versions of the original axioms.

'allow' modified to include tense and prog -- also changed auxiliary 'can' appropriately.  There are some extensive comments on issues that need to be handled regarding tense/negation scoping.  These comments generalize to other sentence level scoping (adv-s, adv-f, etc.) that can interact.

'shock' modified to include tense and prog.  Deleted passive construction rules because that should be generative from the base rules.

'neglect' modified ot include tense and prog.  Deleted passive construction rules.

'ascertain' added tense and prog

'attempt' added tense (prog seems to give a different implication)

'begin' added prog to the consequent, which is universal for all aktionsart.  The non-progressive consequent is only true for process or semelfactive aktionsarts.

passive mappings (TODO):
   [x verb y p -> y can p]        "X allows Y to P" -> "Y can P"
=> [y (pasv verb) p -> y can p]   "Y is allowed to P" -> "Y can P"
   [w verb x -> w]                "That W shocks X" -> "W"
=> [x (pasv x) w -> w]            "X is shocked that W" -> "W"
   

other mappings?:
  adjectival form of verb
   "That W shocks X" -> "W"
   "W is shocking"   -> "W"
