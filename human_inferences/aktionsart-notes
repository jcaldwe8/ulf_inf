We should handle aktionsart at some point:

"x was running" -> "x ran"
"x was building a house" -/-> "x built a house"
"x was sneezing" -> "x sneezed"

"x is runnning" -> "x runs"

; Something like the following....
(all_process_v p.v
  (all_tense t
    (all x
      (x ((t prog) p.v))
      (x (t p.v)))))

Then we can incorporate some aktionsart ontology, say VerbNet, to identify the appropriate matching antecedents.

TODO: how to include polarity, e.g. "x was not running" -> "x did not run"
(assuming same contextual time), but "x was not running" -/-> "x did not run"
(for a different contextual time).
