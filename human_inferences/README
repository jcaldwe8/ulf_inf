This folder contains notes and scripts relating to gathering inferences from
human annotators.  It is very incomplete and needs to be merged with files in
the inference annotator webpage which has more complete guidelines, as well as
scripts used in conjunction with the MegaAttitude dataset to get clause-taking
verb constructions.
