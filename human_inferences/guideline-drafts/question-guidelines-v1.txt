Questions
  a. Question inference types
    * General question inference (inferences based on the fact that a question was asked)
      `Questioner expects that the addressee probably knows the answer and will supply it`
      
      [Q] -> The address probably knows [reified uninverted Q] and will supply it
      [Q] -> The speaker probably doesn't know [reified uninverted Q]

      "Where did John go?"
        -> "The addressee probably knows where John went and will supply it"
        -> "The speaker probably doesn't know where John went"
      "When are you getting married?"
        -> "The addressee probably knows when they are getting married and will supply it"  
        -> "The speaker probably doesn't know when the addressee is getting married"
      {This basically reduces to question identification}
      But this is useful for making inferences about the speaker knowedge
      states in a dialogue.  We can infer what things each person does or does
      not know from the questions they ask and are asked by others.


    * Question-form based presuppositional inferences. (inferences based on the type of question)
      
      [Wh-Q] -> [uninverted Q with 'wh-' replaced by 'some-'] 
      
      "Who did you meet yesterday?"
        -> "The addressee met someone yesterday"
      "What is Betsy Ross famous for?"
        -> "Betsy Ross is famous for something"
      "When did Beethoven die?"
        -> "Beethoven died at some time" -> "Beethoven died"
      "How many people did Randy Craft kill?"
        -> "Randy Craft killed some many people" -> "Randy Craft killed multiple people"
      "What is the official animal of Canada?"
        -> "Something is the official animal of Canada" -> "Canada has an official animal"
      "What is the abbreviation for micro"
        -> "Something is the abbreviation for micro" -> "Micro has an abbreviation"
      "When are you getting married?"
        -> "The addressee are getting married at some time" -> "The addressee will get married in the near future"
      "What is your dog's name?"
        -> "Something is your dog's name" -> "Your dog has a name"
      "Why did you go home?"
        -> "You went home for some reason"
      "In what/which city does John live?"
        -> "John lives in some city" -> "John lives in a city"
      "Whose party are you going to?
        -> "You are going to someone's party" -> "You are going to a party"
      "what were the main reasons why Ophelia went mad?"
        -> "Somethings were the main reasons why Ophelia went mad"
        -> "Ophelia went mad for some reasons"
        -> "Ophelia went mad"
      "How is this sentence an example of a question?"
        -> "This sentence is somehow an example of a question"
        -> "This sentence is an example of a question"

      All the ones with event modifiers, we can just drop, e.g.
        "You went home for some reason" -> "You went home"
        "The addressee will get married in the near future" -> "The addressee will get married"
        "Beethoven died at some time" -> "Beethoven died"
        "The addressee met someone yesterday" -> "The addressee met someone"
        
        Note some prepositions don't work because they're arguments.
        *"Betsy Ross is famous for something" -> "Betsy Ross is famous"

      Notice that yes-no questions don't lead to these sorts of inferences:
        "Are dogs animals" -> "Dogs may be animals"? -> "Somethings are not animals" 
        "Would a square peg fit?" -> "Something doesn't fit" 
      The only inferences seem to be trivial unless a presupposition exists in some part of the question.


    * Situational presuppositional inferences (inferences that can be made without using the question structure)
      "What is your dog's name?"
        -> "The addressee is in possession of a dog"
          [I would more vaguely say, "The addressee has a dog"; e.g., cf.,
           "What is your doctor's name?"]
      "What CBS soap opera was interrupted by the bulletin of John F. Kennedy 's assassination ?"
        -> "There was a bulletin of John F. Kennedy's assassination"
        -> "John F. Kennedy was assassinated"
      "Whose party are you going to?"
        -> "Someone is hosting a party"
      "Did you fail the test?"
        -> "You took the test"
      "Did you see the Taj Mahal while visiting India?"
        -> "You visited India"

    * Negative Questions -- indicates information about the speaker beliefs regarding the answer to the question.
      "Didn't you go home?"
        -> "The speaker thinks that the addressee went home"
      "Wouldn't you help your friend?"
        -> "The speaker thinks that the addressee would help their friend"


  b. Use grep patterns to reduce displayed information.
  c. Ask the annotator to generate such inferences along with the category they fall into.
