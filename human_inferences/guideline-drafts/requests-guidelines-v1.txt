3) Requests
  a. Enumerate inference types
    * implicit request as a direct conversion of original question
        can you ...
          -> I expect/want you to ...
    
    * situational inference
        "Is x here?"
          -> "The speaker is probably on the phone or at an entrance"
        "Could I get the check?"/"Could you get me the check?"
          -> "The speaker is probably a patron at a sit-down restaurant"
          -> "The speaker thinks the hearer works at the restaurant"
    
    * Negative requests (request is negative to the surface question) This is
      similar to a basic request but with the presupposition that the addressee
      currently isn't or doesn't plan to complete the request (at least in the
      speaker's view).  Thus the request is weaker, 'want' or 'think you should'
      rather than 'expect'.

        "Can't you be friendly?"
          -> "I (want you|think you should) to be friendly"
          -> "I don't see a reason for you to not be friendly"
          -> "You are not being or don't plan to be friendly"
        [Depends of "friendly to WHOM" -- it it's the addresee, the 
        implication is also "You are not being friendly"; if it's future
        directed, then this need not be implied; "When I meet the mayor,
        I'm going to be very business-like." Reply: "Can't you be friendly?"]

  b. Use grep patterns to reduce displayed information.
  c. For the sentence ask the annotator to select the inference classification
     and provide resulting sentence/ULF.  Allow them to mark that there is no
     appropriate category, or multiple if ambiguous.


    
Possible Question Types for Future Experiments
    * inferred request not directly mapped from question
        "Is x here?"
          -> "I expect you to get x if they are nearby"
          [risky? but interesting to try]
          {GK: I agree}
    * indirect intention inference
        "Is x here?"
          -> "I probably want to speak to x"
        [likewise]
