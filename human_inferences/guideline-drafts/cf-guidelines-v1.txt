Counterfactuals

  ==Expected forms==

  These expected forms allow us to get a handle on the different sentences that
  could be affected and then make statements about them.  We could make finer
  distinctions at the annotation level to help with the inference procedure,
  but we'll keep it simple for now.  This structure guides the annotators, but
  the annotators will still need to write out the inference they mean.

  *Basic if-then*
  [antecedent S1] [consequent S2] 
    Examples:
      If I were/was rich, I would own a boat
      If I had gone home, I would have gotten a good night's sleep
      Were I rich, I would own a boat
      Had I gone home, I would have gotten a good night's sleep
      If I leave on time, I will be there by 5
      If I get sick I will go to the hospital (? -> I am not sick -- it seems that change of state in any if implies that the state is not currently fulfilled) 
      If you are feeling sick, you must take medicine
  
  *Inverted if-then*
  [consequent S1] [antecedent S2]
    Examples:
      I would own a boat if I were rich
      I would own a boat, were I rich
      He will be here if he saw the note
      I would have gotten a good night's sleep had I gone home

  *Wish*
  I wish [S]
    Examples:
      I wish I owned a boat
      I wish John would help
      I wish for him to get better
      I wish he was getting better

  Additional Marking [maybe skip this part]
    [antecedent S1] - past/present/subjunctive, perf/no perf
    [consequent S2] - will/would, perf/no perf
      {I use will/would instead since it's sometimes ambiguous what the tense is because of fake tense.  But isn't this true for the antecedent too?}
    [S] - past/pres, perf/no perf
  
  Antecendents on if-then clauses start with 'if' or are subject-auxiliary
  inverted (like some questions).  They tend not to have a future marking
  (will/would).  Consequents are often marked with 'will'/'would' or another
  modal 'must'/'might'.  Besides, the antecedent and consequent identification
  in conditional statements from the meaning interpretation.

  Assume that all the tense and aspect is stripped from the sentences for
  writing the inferences below.  So pres, past, will, perf are all stripped.
  Leave embedded negations.

  Possible Inferences
    (not (past S))
    (not (pres S)) 
      I wish he wouldn't keep saying that
      "He keeps saying that" - (not (he.pro (would.aux-v not (keep.v (ka (say.v that.pro))))))
    ;;(not (will S))
    Other derivations
      e.g. I wish for him to get better -> He is not well (hard to get?)
                                        -> He may get better
                                        -> He may not get better
                                        -> I hope that he will get better (paraphr.)]
           Same for paraphrase "I wish he gets better".

    ; only include below if it seems necessary.  These don't seem to be
    ; inferred in any of these constructions.  Rather a negation or uncertainty
    ; is inferred.  This makes sentences since conditionals are uninformative if
    ; we know the condition holds (i.e. we can just state the consequent).
    (past S)
    (pres S)
    (will S)

  
  Provide examples of inference and non-inferential sentences.
    - "If I was rich, I would own a boat" -> "I am not rich"
                                         [also -> I don't own a boat]
    - "If I was rich, I would have owned a boat" -> "I was not rich"
                                         [also -> I didn't own a boat]
    - "If you were/are feeling sick, you must take medicine" -/-> "You are feeling sick"
       [This looks like poor English to me; should "were" be "are"?]
    - "I wish I were rich" -> "I am not rich"
    - "I wish for him to get better" -/-> "He will not get better"
                                  [also -> He is not well (hard to get?)
                                        -> He may get better
                                        -> He may not get better
                                        -> I hope that he will get better (paraphr.)]
                                  [Also, all this is really inferencing from what
                                  the speaker seems to believe (perhaps wrongly),
                                  i.e., sincere, well-informed speakers]
    - "I wish he was getting better" -> "He is not getting better"
  
  For the sentence, ask for structural (particularly counterfactual) inferences, if any.  Ask to explicitly mark that there are none.
  Finally, store original sentence along with inference-annotator pairs (also store if there are none)
