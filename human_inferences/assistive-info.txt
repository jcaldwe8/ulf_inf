; Constructions => possible implications
; We can enumerate these.  Then when an implicative is looked up, we can list
; the possible constructions for the verb (via megaattitude).  Have the annotator
; select the appropriate constrution, which will then list the possbile
; inferences for the construction.  Then they select that and write down the
; associated inferred sentence.
;
; How to handle negative polarity?  Have separate rules for them that mark it as such... maybe 'not' or 'negp'.

x accept that w => w

someone accept(s/ed) that something happened => something happened
