Presupposition (S2), conversational implicature (S3), conventional implicature (S4)

Areas that don't deal with 'truth-conditional' content.  This is not a fully
appropriate name because presupposition and implicature can be evaluated for
truth so it is often alternatively called *at-issue* or *proffered* content.

NB: 'truth-conditional' content is equivalent to what Frege calls 'sense' and 
what Grice calls 'what is said'.

Section 2: Presupposition

*pragmatic* presupposition: purely speaker actions
  Conditions for speaker interaction including language-use (e.g. both speaking
  the same language), turn-taking norms, contextual plans and goals.  Can't be
  traced to specific words or phrases.


*semantic* presupposition: conventional aspects of words and constructions
  Encoded in specific words or constructions called *triggers*.  Can lead to
  unintentional presuppositions.

*utterance presupposition* used by Karttunen 1974, Soames 1982 to capture the
mix of semantic and pragmatic properties.  That is, semantic in the sense that
some statements presuppose information without the speaker's intent via
triggers, but pragmatic in the sense that presuppositions must be evaluated in
the context of the utterance (including the common ground of the discourse
participants).

Some argue that all presuppositions are pragmatic [led by Stalnaker] and should
be analyzed that way.  Dynamic semantics approaches (i.e. Discourse
Representation structures) provide a semantics approach to handling some of
these phenomena.  Keenan 1971 argues both are real -- seems non-committal 
Related TODO: look over these papers to get the major picture from each
approach.

Sample of presuppositions and triggers:
  i.    Aspectual predicates "continue" and "stop" (Simons 2001; Abusch 2002; Abrusan 2011)
          Jane didn't quit laughing (Simons 2001)
            -> Jane was laughing immediately prior to the reference time of sentence
          NB: from paper, this is a *non-detachable* presupposition.  That is,
          the presupposed information is not detachable from the content of the
          utterance since any synonyms/rewording of the same content leads to
          the same presupposition, e.g.
            Jane didn't cease langhing,
            Jane did not discontinue her laughter
          Same seems to be true for all change of state predicates (e.g. leave,
          exit, realize, etc.)

  ii.   Attitude predicates "know", "realize", "regret" (Kiparsky & Kiparsky 1970; Karttunen 1973, 1974; Heim 1992; Abusch & Rooth 2004; Beaver 2001, 2010)
          Bill doesn't know that baldness is hereditary (Karttunen 1973)
            -> Baldness is hereditary
          Fred no longer resents Zelda's infidelity (Karttunen 1973)
            -> Zelda has been unfaithful

  iii.  Definite determiners and demonstratives (Strawson 1950; Frege 1982/1970; Russell 1905 ...)
          The king of France is wise (Strawson 1950 -- I think the example is originally from Russell)
            -> There is a single salient king of France
          He went home
            -> There's a single salient male referent

          NB: If the presupposition does not hold the original sentence is
          false or fail to say a true or false statement depending on the
          analysis.

  iv.   Indefinite determiners (Karttunen 1976; Kamp 1981; Prince 1981; Heim 1982,1983; Elbourne 2005)
          (Karttunen 1976)
          I owned a car. It was a Mustang.
          I needed a car. *It was a Mustag.

          Given a specific reading of the indefinite, it implies the existences
          of a specific instance satisfying the sentence.  For a non-specific
          reading no referent is added.

  v.    Pronouns (Karttunen 1976; Kamp 1981; Prince 1981; Heim ...)
  vi.   Proper names (Prince 1981)
  vii.  Quantifier domains (Cooper 1983; Gawron 1996; Abusch & Rooth 2004; Roberts 1995,2004)
  viii. Sortal restrictions (Thomason 1972)
  ix.   Additive particles like "too", "also", "either" (Karttunen 1974; Heim 1992; ...)
  x.    Adjunct clauses headed by prepositions like "before", "after" (Heinamaki 1974; ...)
  xi.   Appositives (Potts 2002; Schlenker 2009,2010)
  xii.  Clefts (Soames 1982; Delin 1992,1995; Prince 1986)
  xiii. Discourse paricles like "even", "only" (von Fintel 1999; Buring & Hartmann 2001; ...)
  xiv.  Implicative verbs like "manage" and "fail" (Karttunen 1971; Karttunen & Peters 1979)
  xv.   Intonational contours, including topic and focus accents and verum focus (Jackendogg 1972 ...)
  xvi.  Evidentials (McCready 2005; McCready & Asher 2006; Sauerland & Schenner 2007)
  xvii. Manner adverbs like "quickly" (Abbott 2000)

  Presuppositions in (ix)-(xvii) can be false without making the at-issue
  content meaningless.  For example, "Kim managed to pass" (xiv) presupposes
  that Kim was expected not to pass.  Even if this presupposition is false, the
  at-issue content that Kim passed still holds.  Presuppositions (i)-(viii) on
  the other hand have a closer link between the presupposed and at-issue
  content.  For example "The student is here" (iii) becomes meaningless if
  there is not a single salient student.
