Inference eval components:


Human inferences
````````````````````
Data: sentences with at least one inference of each core category (inference of "no inferences" as appropriate)

Format?
Probably simple .tsv of

[sentence]\t[sentence metadata]\t[inferred sentence]\t[inference metadata]
OR
[usid]\t[sentence]\t[isid]\t[inference]  with separate files for [usid]\t[sentence metadata] and [isid]\t[inference metadata]


Human ULF annotations
```````````````````````
[usid]\t[isid]\t[sentence]\t[ulf]
usid: ulf sid
isid: inf sid

Please run get_ulf_annotations.sh generate the formatted ULF files.  You will
need to know the password of the SQL database to run this script completely.

Inference system

Specific inference issues:
1. requests should not be made if embedded in a question
2. don't make counterfactual inferences in quetions "what would you do?"
3. add negative request inferences
