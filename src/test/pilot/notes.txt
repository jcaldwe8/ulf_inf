Existence of a diectic marker (it, there, here, the, that, etc.)




if x then y might have a -> y didn't a
if x then y might not have a -> y did a,
  e.g. "Had I taken his advice, I might have succeeded"
    -> "I did not succeed"

[CF [might have succeeded]]
-> [not [might have succeeded]]
-> [not [possibly succeeded]]
-> [not succeeded]

similarly
      "I Had I taken his advice, I might not have failed"
  ->  "I failed"
[CF [might not have failed]
-> [not [might not have failed]]
-> [not [possibly didn't fail]]
-> [not didn't fail]
-> [failed]
