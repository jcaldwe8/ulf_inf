# ULF Natural Logic Inference

This project is aimed to demonstrate the capacity to perform Natural Logic-like
inference on unscoped logical forms (ULF) of Episodic Logic.  We currently work
on the FraCaS dataset, following in the footsteps of MacCartney and Manning's
2007 paper "Natural Logic for Textual Inference".
