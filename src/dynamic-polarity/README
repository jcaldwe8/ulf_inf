This folder contains code for dynamically obtaining polarity annotations via
the Stanford CoreNLP NatLog system.  init.lisp contains the commands that are
needed to properly load the functions and dependencies given proper
installation of dependencies.

The main function for external use is 'get-segment-polarity' which takes a
segement of the ulf formula of interest, its parent, and the fullulf.  This
function uses the exact references to these for matching, so the segment and
parent must actually be referentially the same lists as in the full ulf
formula.  You can look at the end of dynamic-polarity.lisp for examples of uses
and expected output.

In order faster speeds, you can call 'run-natlog' on the list of strings before
the experiments.  The default behavior of 'run-natlog' is to memoize (i.e. save
results from previous runs) so future calls are faster.  'run-natlog' has a 
large overhead for unmemoized calls so calling it with a big batch ahead of time
for all the sentences that will be used is faster.
  'run-natlog-ulfs' is the corresponding is the variant for ULFs.
