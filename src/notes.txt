High-level inference steps:

Input: ULF, u1

1. Preliminary canonicalization and normalization rules on u1 without macro 
   expansion or word reordering.
    > make currying standards consistent
    > eliminate redundant formulas
    > canonicalize aliased operators (e.g. not -> not.adv-s)
2. Perform inferences that happen pre-macro expansion and word-reordering.
   This includes many presuppositional and structure-based inferences, e.g.
     "Can you do x?" -> "I want you to do x"
   Store these inferences as preinf_1, preinf_2, ..., preinf_n
3. Expand macros and fully normalize.
4. Perform post-expansion inferences.
  Store inferences as postinf_1, postinf_2, ..., postinf_m

Further perform inferences on strictly entail inferences (which should be
marked) through the same process.
