This directory contains the source code for the ULF Inference Project.

*Directory/File Organization*
  init.lisp
    Initialization script for running the inference code.
  
  init-test.lisp
    Initialization script for testing the inference code.
    NB: This must be loaded in a fresh REPL.  Loading the testing library results
        in a name conflict if done after loading init.lisp.
  
  inference.lisp
    Core inference functionlity.
  
  *-inferences.lisp
    Code for inferences of each phenomenon.
  
  ttt-*.lisp
    Any TTT related code.
  
  util-*.lisp
    Utility functions that may be useful in mulitple files.
  
  test/
    All test functions are contained in here, with more subdirectories for 
    conceptually grouped sets of tests.
  
  example/
    Example scripts.

  dynamic-polarity/
    Code for getting dynamic polarity marking of ULF formulas.


*Testing*

Testing is done with lisp-unit, a simple unit testing framework. Please see the
following for documentation on using lisp-unit
(https://github.com/OdonataResearchLLC/lisp-unit/wiki) 
If you have quicklisp installed, init-test.lisp will load it up for you.  The 
interface for defining tests is pretty simple.  You can take a look at 
test/pilot/len-pilot-tests.lisp for examples of it, though I used a couple of
macros to reduce redundancy, so it might be hard to understand.
