1. Look at Len's code to send info on TTT mapping rules (!).
2. Make a version of len-pilot-tests.lisp that uses the actual inference
   pipeline rather than the hardcoded ruleset.
3. Port the rest of the tests in test/pilot
4. Update inference pipeline according to needs of tests
5. Extend tests with undergrad tests (ask them to add it after showing how to
   do it).
6. Add tests from sampling/discussion.
