1. Port the rest of the tests in test/pilot
2. Update inference pipeline according to needs of tests
  2a. The consequent of if-then statements are not necessarily counterfactuals, sometimes they only make sense given the antecedent.
  2b. Future less likely instances have "probably will not" inferences
  2c. (past will.aux-s) --[normalizes to]--> (past do.aux-s).  
      "Having worked too hard, John would not go to the party" -> "John did not go to the party".
3. Extend tests with undergrad tests (ask them to add it after showing how to
   do it).
4. Add tests from sampling/discussion.
