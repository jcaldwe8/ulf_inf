Summary:

*General sample*
65 formulas

*Selective sample*
71 formulas
45 good inferences from 39 formulas
8 context dependently correcy from 4 formulas
13 incorrect from 10

Errors due to sentences that did not appear in the small ~10 sentence 
development set we used.
  action-based counterfactuals: "If I were to V"
  non-request generic questions: "Can you ride horses?"

The inferences tend to fail on:
  If x.pro were to V

We probably want to infer:
  x.pro doesn't plan to V
  "If I were to travel to Europe"
  x.pro doesn't expect to V
  "If I were to win the lottery"
or even in some cases [maybe this is just doesn't expect, with more semantic information regarding impossibility]
  x.pro will not V
  "If I were to be born again"


Also on questions that aren't really requests:
1. Generic 'you' asking whether an action/event is possible
  "Can you tell wheat and barley apart?"
2. Question about ability without much of request-like meaning
  "Can you ride horses?"
  "Can you do bookkeeping?"
