Note from Len via email on 3/26/2018:

BTW, I think that subordinate wh-clauses, e.g., "John knows who called" contain
a reification operator 'ans-to' ("answer to"). The exception is 'whether',
which I believe is the composite (ans-to (? <decl-sent>)), where '?' shifts a
sentence meaning to a question meaning. Roughly, question meanings can be
viewed as characteristic functions over propositions and possible worlds (or
episodes/situations) , yielding '1' for any proposition in any world where the
proposition truly answers the question. 'If' has two meaninga, one as
conditional connective, the other equivalent to 'whether'. ("I have no idea if
he's at home".)
