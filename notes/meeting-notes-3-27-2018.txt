- Still working on first version of inference annotation interface.
- It's coming along, but not quite complete
  * Got skeleton of the website up -- but still need to implement the actual interface for annotation
  * Figured out how to get it up on AWS so that we should be able to include
    stuff like syntax highlighting, maybe even automatic POS annotations.

This week:
- finish first draft of interface by Friday at the latest (should have it by tomorrow night...).
- prototype a bit
- clean up the guidelines (they'll be very rough).

- Regarding the Thesis Proposal, I'm worried that I won't have time to prepare
  the propsal thoroughly considering the rate of the current research project
  progress. I'd really like to include that to show the two side of my thesis:
    (1) the annotation for ulf generation
    (2) using ULF for inference
  
  Without petitioning I'd have to complete it by May 8th.
  Scott busy most of that week, so complete by May 2/3rd.  
  Need to send out proposal 2 weeks before so I'd have to complete
  the proposal by April 18th, which is only 3 weeks from now.

  Maybe I should apply for an extension and do it either over the summer or
  in the fall?
