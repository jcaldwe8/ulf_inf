This folder contains files for generating ULF ids that each annotator annotated
since a given time and is certain and the files that were generated by this
procedure.  

request-sid.sql contains a sql file for getting this for a single
annotator.  This script was used for generating aech of the *-ulf-anns.tsv
files.  

compile-unique-ids.py is used to generate all_ulf_anns.txt and 
assigned_ulf_anns.txt.  Note that the python file refers to files outside of
this directory for identifying which ids were assigned. 

Finally, a script outside of this directory generated assigned_inf_anns.txt
by refering to the full dataset metadata to get the ulf_ann -> inf_ann 
mapping.
