This is the folder that contains the ULF sentence ids that I assigned and sent
to each annotator for the 2018 inference experiment.  These ids were generated
via a sampling procedure to get sentences that are likely to contain the
phenomena of interest, as well as some random sampling without the specific
features.  Not all of these sentences were used in the inference experiments
since we weren't able to confidently annotate ULFs for all of them.
