Short-term
* Incorporate the morphology list into the pattern matching
* Add patterns for questions
* Download the gutenburg project data
  - need filter for weird texts (e.g. the bible), or old texts (e.g. beowulf)
    or maybe none... not sure yet...
    Maybe based on translation time (modern translations of old texts may be fine)
  - Determine how to get sentence boundaries (maybe use NLTK or Stanford since
    this is more structured text).
* Record stats of samples for datasets
* Add multiword coverage to Uppen Morph data.
* Figure out the relationship between impl-list.txt, imp.lisp, and weak-imp.lisp in stratos-data.


Long-term
* Maybe think of a better structure to the datasets so that the ignored files
can all sit in the same location (so we don't need to update the gitignore
every time we add a dataset).
