Short-term
* Get regex schemas working for all patterns.
* Look at elemma and uppen impl lists and make sure there aren't any major inconsistencies.
* Regularize suffixes and punctuation in other datasets (before testing on new patterns since they assume this regularization)
* Test request patterns on more datasets
* Filter "you know [^that]" from the switchboard corpus
* Sentence boundary on switchboard is really bad (maybe we can see where the turn taking happens -- if the other person just responds with Uh-huh, or yeah, or something similar (maybe less than 3 tokens) we assume the current speaker is on the same sentence?
* Merge uppen_morph handling with other resources into a more integrated codebase.
* Getting LOTS of false positives on switchboard requests
* Add patterns for questions
* Download the gutenburg project data
  - need filter for weird texts (e.g. the bible), or old texts (e.g. beowulf)
    or maybe none... not sure yet...
    Maybe based on translation time (modern translations of old texts may be fine)
  - Determine how to get sentence boundaries (maybe use NLTK or Stanford since
    this is more structured text).
* Record stats of samples for datasets
* Add multiword coverage to Uppen Morph data.
* Figure out the relationship between impl-list.txt, imp.lisp, and weak-imp.lisp in stratos-data.


Long-term
* Maybe think of a better structure to the datasets so that the ignored files
can all sit in the same location (so we don't need to update the gitignore
every time we add a dataset).
