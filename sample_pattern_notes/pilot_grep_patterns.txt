Here are the selection methods I used.  Basically I wrote up a simple grep
function for each phenomenon that covers a variable, but not representative,
subset.


Requests:

Starts with "Can" or "Could" and ends with a question mark.

  grep -P "(Can|Could) .*\?"

Hence, we got a bunch of simple questions that start the same way.  In
hindsight I should have included "Would", "Will", etc or even more interesting
patterns including negations, "need" somewhere in the sentence.  Actually,
that's why I named the file "tatoeba-simple-requests" because I was planning to
get more complex patterns, but I forgot to go back to that once I started
annotating...


Counterfactual If conditionals

  grep -P "If .*(was|were|had).*\."

Starts with "If", contains "was", "were", "had" somewhere in the sentence and
ends in a period.  I added the "was", "were", "had" condition because we just
got a too many simple conditionals otherwise.  I could have gotten a list of
past-participles to make a more complex pattern that covered cases like "If I
ran I would be healthy", but I figured we're trying to show inference capacity,
not necessarily representative coverage.  I think the pattern still left enough
variability in the sentences for interesting inferences.  We still got some
simple conditionals when "was"/"were"/"had" appeared in the consequent.


Inverted If

Starts with "Were", "Had"

  grep -P "(Were|Had) .*"


Wish:

"wish" occurs somewhere in the sentence

  grep -P ".*(wish|Wish).*"


I then just annotated the first 12-14 sentences in each of those sets, skipping
ones where we haven't covered how to do the annotations.  Most of the sentences
that I skipped used it-extraposition, which we haven't completely zoned in on
how to annotate.  It-extraposition is really common in negated conditionals:
"If it were not for your advice...", "If it had not been for your raincoat,
...", "If it were not for your family, ...", etc.
