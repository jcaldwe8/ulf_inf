Here are the selection methods I used.  Basically I wrote up a simple grep
function for each phenomenon that covers a variable, but not representative,
subset.


Requests:

Starts with "Can" or "Could" and ends with a question mark.

  For Tatoeba
  grep -P "(Would|Will|Can|Could) .*\?"
  grep -P ".* (I|We|we) need .*"
  grep -P "May I .*?"
  *neg*
  grep -P "(Won't|Wouldn't|Can't|Couldn't) .*\?"
  grep -P ".* (would|could|wouldn't|couldn't|won't|can't) you\?" -- (You wouldn't drop this off for me, would you?; I can't drop this off, could you?)
  *other indirect*
  grep -P "Must you .*\?"

  General
  grep -P ".* (would|will|can|could) you .*"
  grep -P ".* (I|We|we|you) need .*"
  grep -P ".* may I .*"
  grep -P "Could I .*"
  *neg*
  grep -P ".*(won't|wouldn't|can't|couldn't) .*\?"
  grep -P ".*(would|could|wouldn't|couldn't|won't|can't) you(\?| \?)"
  grep -P ".*(must|Must) you .*\?"

  -- make sure punctuation is handled appropriately (some datasets don't have them or add spaces before them)
  -- make sure capitalization is handled appropriately (some datasets don't capitalize, or are inconsistent)


TODO: generalize cf patterns to non-Tatoeba datasets (i.e. embedded forms, inconsistent punctuation and capitalization)

Counterfactual If conditionals

  grep -P "If .*(was|were|had).*\."
  
  General
  grep -P ".*(if|If) .*(was|were|had|<past verb>|<past participle>).*"
  grep -P ".*(if|If) .*(was|were|had|<past verb>|<past participle>).* (would|wouldn't|will|won't|'d) .*" -- version with only counterfactuals

Starts with "If", contains "was", "were", "had" somewhere in the sentence and
ends in a period.  I added the "was", "were", "had" condition because we just
got a too many simple conditionals otherwise.  I could have gotten a list of
past-participles to make a more complex pattern that covered cases like "If I
ran I would be healthy", but I figured we're trying to show inference capacity,
not necessarily representative coverage.  I think the pattern still left enough
variability in the sentences for interesting inferences.  We still got some
simple conditionals when "was"/"were"/"had" appeared in the consequent.
TODO: get list of past participles and simple past tense forms of verbs
"If <past S>, ..." -> not <present S>
"If <pluperfect S>, ..." -> not <past S>
Maybe we should also sample some simple conditionals as a control for our inferences.

What about conditionals that express not only a conditional, but also that the antecedent is unlikely to be fulfilled (also has not yet been fulfilled):
  "If he took this syrup, he would feel better"
  "If he married a princess, he would save his company"
Note the difference with:
  "If he married a princess, he would have saved his company"
The "If he married a princess" has a definite past tense interpretation in the latter example, but not in the former. Also, the following shows that the antecedent alone is not enough to determine the factuality:
  "If he married a princess, he must have saved his company"


Inverted If
(Same pattern as CF conditionals except swap the antecedent and consequent positions)

"He would feel better if he took this syrup"
"I'd own a boat if I was rich"



Starts with "Were", "Had"

  grep -P "(Were|Had) .*"

"Had I known, I would have ..."
"Were I rich, I'd own a boat"
Inverted variants of conditional CF.


Counterfactual prefer:

"I would prefer it were red" -- counterfactual
"I would prefer that the US had 51 states" -- counterfactual
"I prefer knowing John" -- factive
"I prefer owning a car over the alternative you are proposing" -- factive


"I would be sitting at home right now if I could"
  -> "I am unable to be sitting at home right now"
  -> "I am not sitting at home right now"



Wish:

"wish" occurs somewhere in the sentence

  grep -P ".*(wish|Wish).*"
    OR
  grep -P ".*(wish|Wish).*<past verb/past participle>.*" - counterfactuals limited

I then just annotated the first 12-14 sentences in each of those sets, skipping
ones where we haven't covered how to do the annotations.  Most of the sentences
that I skipped used it-extraposition, which we haven't completely zoned in on
how to annotate.  It-extraposition is really common in negated conditionals:
"If it were not for your advice...", "If it had not been for your raincoat,
...", "If it were not for your family, ...", etc.

  NB: only counterfactual if the complement is a tensed complementizer phrase.
  The following are not counterfactual:
    - "We wish you a Merry Christmas"
    - "He wished for a car"
    - "She wishes to go to Holland for her sabbatical"

"I wish he would eat better"  -> "If he would eat better, I would be less worried"
"I wish he were tall"         -> "If he were tall, he would need my help all the time"
"I wish I had a car"          -> "If I had a car I would drive everyday"
"I wish I had had a car"      -> "If I had had a car I would have been able to hold a job"
"I wish I were a poet"        -> "If I were a poet I would understand Shakespeare"


Questions:



Attitudinal/Communicative verbs:
- both dictionary lookup and pattern-based


Implicatives:
- both dictionary lookup and pattern-based
Use list at ~/research/stratos-data/impl-list.txt -- TODO: split into implicatives and attitudinal
  -- get the tensed variants through wordnet?


Idea:
Maybe we should have a way to mark the type of inference:
  - assertion 
  - conversational implicature
  - presupposition
since the type change how widely they can be used and under what conditions they can be cancelled without contradiction.  For example, conversational implicatures can be defeated, rather than contradicted.  Notice below:
  - "She used to swim everday.  I wonder if she still does."
The following example seems to indicate that the counterfactual inference is implicated rather than asserted.
  - "If the patient had measles, he would have exactly the symptoms he has now.  We could conclude, therefore, that the patient has measles."
Also, counterfactuals don't seem to be asserted since we can assert the counterfactual claim without redundancy:
  - "If the butler had done it, we would have found blood on the kitchen knife.  The knife was clean; therefore, the butler did not do it."
