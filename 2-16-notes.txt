Notes for what I did:
  - Organized data, added basic documentation, put data in a repo (things were
    getting scattered...)
  - Wrote scripts for getting morphological data.
  - Reformatted scripts for better generalizability.  
  - Verified coverage of the morphological data (from U-Penn) over the
    implicatives we care about.
