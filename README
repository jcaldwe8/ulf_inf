Research on inferences derived from ULF.  Currently the NLog inferences are in a
different folder (ulf_natural_logic), but I plan to merge these in the future as
the research converges.  


Preliminary sampled datasets are in /localdisk/ulf_inf/sampled_datasets in 
m09.cs.rochester.edu because the redundant datasets are taking too much space 
for the shared filesystem.
