Words in the Stratos implicatives list not found in Uppen morph (based on
check_uppen_morph_coverage.py -- check_v2()):
  fact        - only in impl-list.txt
  influence   - only in impl-list.txt
  make sure   - only in impl-list.txt (but we can have rule: X make sure that Y -> Y)
  mindboggle  - only in impl-list.txt
  prevail on  - only in impl-list.txt
  truth       - only in impl-list.txt
  turn out    - rules exist (need to add some how)

We can probably ignore all but 'make sure' and 'turn out'.  These we'll have to
add custom (similar to custom_e_lemmas.txt).
