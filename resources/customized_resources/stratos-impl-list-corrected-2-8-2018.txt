; Version of list Mar. 6, 2018.  Corrections made from previous version:
; 2/8/2018
; purplex -> perplex
; saction -> sanction
; removed redundant words
; 3/6/2018
; removed 'have' since we can't think of a good implicative inference [ maybe the perfect aspect which implies past, but that's not useful for us... ]
