    This package contains the morphological database file, the DB database
package from the University of California at Berkeley, and source code
for various utilities.  The database in the tar file is in ASCII format
(a so-called 'flat' file).  Another database file in DB format will be
created from the ASCII file when the package is installed.  

Once you have installed the package, you'll find several directories:

./bin:  executables for utility programs.
./data: database files.
./hash: DB database package (from UC-Berkeley)
./lib:  package libraries
./src:  C and Lisp source code for utilities and database access.

This package has been tested under Solaris 2.5 (and its cc).  The Lisp
access functions have been tested under Lucid 4.0.2.  See the INSTALL
file for installation instructions.  Please note that the hash package
is provided "as is": The particular Berkeley hash package being used
here has been superseded so it is unlikely that it is supported
anymore. We will move to the latest Berkeley db version in the future.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------

Edit the Makefile to reflect your local installation. Set PWD to the
directory where you installed morph-1.5. You need libXaw.so.5
installed on your machine. 

Under Solaris using cc seems to work better than using gcc. If you can
get a clean compile under gcc (under Solaris or on other platforms)
please let us know.

run "make all"
run "make morph_english.db"

QUICK START:
------------

run "./bin/xmdbm -db ./data/morph_english.db"

BRIEF PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------------

NB: All programs (except xmdbm) will print out a description of
their invocation syntax if run without arguments.

morph_createdb
--------------
    SYNTAX: morph_createdb <text file>

    DESCRIPTION: Creates a DB format file from a flat text file.

morph_printdb
-------------
    SYNTAX: morph_printdb <DB-format file>

    DESCRIPTION: Creates a flat file from a DB file.  This program
                 is called from xmdbm to maintain an ASCII readable 
		 version of the database.

xmdbm
-----
    SYNTAX: xmdbm [X options] [options]

    DESCRIPTION: X window database maintenance program, allowing
		 users to look-up, modify, add, and delete entries 
		 in the DB format file. All changes are recorded in 
		 a log file.  Upon exiting, morph_printdb is run in 
		 the background to update the flat version of the 
		 database.

    OPTIONS:
	-db <DBfile>  Maintain <DBfile>
	-create <DBfile>  Make a new database named <DBfile>.
	-log <file>  Use <file> as the log instead of the default.
	-readonly    Allow user to lookup, but not to modify the
		     database.
	-nolog       Don't record session in log file.
	-options     List these options.

	Standard X command line options are also available.

morph_timedretrieve
-------------------
    SYNTAX: morph_timedretrieve <DB-format file>

    DESCRIPTION: Prompts for keyword, returning the contents along
	         with timing information.


Important src/ Files
--------------------

   db-interface.l: Lisp functions and structures for calling 
		   C functions in dbfuns.c.  Currently runs 
	 	   under Lucid 4.0.2.

   dbfuns.c: C routines for operations on a DB-format file, including access
             to an encoded database (see coding.c).  Included in the morph
             library in ./lib/ and called from Lisp functions in 
	     db-interface.l.

   morph.h: Includes the inflectional information codes and database
            parameters.

   coding.c: These routines implement the encoding and decoding scheme of the 
             morphological entries.  

   inflection.c: This contains the routines for creating standard inflections
		 of nouns, proper nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
