Language processing resources for the ULF inference project. 
At this point all the resources are files contains lexicons for particular
phenomena or mappings between word forms.  This may change in the future to
include proper programming libraries.  

The top-level scripts are used to process the original resources into the form
that I'm interested in, whether that be the file formatting or simplifying the
resource to only contain information that I care about.  All python scripts
intended for external use as modules are contained in subdirectories for the
files contained within. 

Top subdirectories are mostly original resources (perhaps with an additional
level to add a script without modification of the resource folder).  The
directory named 'customized_resources' contain resources that were modified
from the original form by us to fix errors, add missing information, or to
make it compatible with use with other resources.

TODO: if we add other types of resources (other than lemma transformations and
      lemma lists) we should make top-level subdirectories named according to
      purpose and have the original and customized resources within those
      folders.
