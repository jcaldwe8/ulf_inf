See pilot_cf_request_inf/ for the inference code written by Len that we will
build off of.





Steps to complete:

* Compile a list of distinct inference forms we're likely to encounter (look
  through a sample of sentences separate from the one being built right now).
    Gene needs to generate a sample of sentences that are verified to not
    overlap with the dataset.

* Write ULF regularization code (Gene has something that already does some of this...).
* Write general inference framework and design the necessary representations
  (Gene will spearhead this)
* Enable the use of the implicative inference rules under resources/stratos/
  for ULFs (they're written for EL right now).  This will require
  reinterpreting the rules within a ULF context and then applying them to
  ULFs (most likely through TTT patterns).
* Write TTT rules, or axioms that can be 


Rules should be general enough that they would work for general discourse
settings.  If they are domain-specific, it should be noted and grouped
separately so our experiments can reflect that.
